# Blue Tick? No Thanks!

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/eaf8e416-1e3a-411a-85ab-8ba06d478d0d/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/blue-tick-no-thanks/deploys)

There are a lot of people who would rather not pay for the "benefit" of having a blue tick next to their name on Twitter.

Instead, you could help to make a difference!

## How to add a new option to the list

Fork this repository, and add the following details to `data.json`:

* id (all lowercase, no spaces)
* organisation (name of the charity)
* description (it should complete the sentence "Rather than paying for a Blue Tick, you could&hellip;")
* url (linking directly to a page where the user can donate)

## Endorsement

This website is just a fun way to compare the cost of a Twitter Blue subscription to other, kore worthy causes. The charities and organisations featured here have not endorsed or asked to be featured, they are just causes that I think are worth supporting.

You can contact me on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@chris5marsh) or, ironically, on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/chris5marsh) (which I do _not_ pay for).
